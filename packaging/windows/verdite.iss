; Run the game's packaging/windows/build-windows.ps1 first: this installs an
; already published tree and does not build one, and every name below comes from
; the environment that script sets out of the game's packaging/package.env.
;
; The installer deliberately does NOT ask for the disc. The game is built on
; first launch, from the image the player picks in the app itself, into
; %LOCALAPPDATA%\<name> -- so the install directory stays read-only, an
; uninstall leaves saves alone, and reinstalling does not force a rebuild.

; The version comes from the script, by the rule scripts/version.sh gives. A
; literal fallback here would be a second source of it and would quietly ship an
; installer whose name disagreed with its contents, so a missing value is an
; error instead; the same for the names.

; assembly goes with them, which costs a rebuild on reinstall and is the right
