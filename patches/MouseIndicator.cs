/// <summary>
/// What tells the player the pointer has been captured or given back: a small
/// white pixel-art mouse in the top right of the game picture, faded in when the
/// state changes and faded out again a moment later. Ported from Verdite2's
/// Kf2.MouseIndicator.
///
/// **It replaces a toast, and the toast was the bug.** Capturing and releasing
/// the pointer is something a player does *while playing* — it is how you get to
/// the menu bar and back — so it happens often, and a titled notification card
/// sliding in over the game every time is a modal-looking interruption reporting
/// a state the player just asked for. The state is a boolean and the change is
/// the only interesting moment, so the whole of it fits in one glyph that
/// announces itself and then leaves.
///
/// **The glyph carries the state and the fade carries the change.** Captured is
/// a solid mouse; released is the same silhouette with a diagonal cut through it,
/// which is the universal "off" and so needs no learning. Both are drawn as pixel
/// blocks rather than as a font glyph or a texture, at an integer number of
/// screen pixels a cell, so they stay crisp at any interface scale and read as
/// part of a 1996 game rather than as desktop chrome.
///
/// It is anchored to <c>OutputView</c> — the game picture, not the window — so an
/// overlay sits over the game's own image and not over the port's menu bar or the
/// letterbox bar beside a 4:3 picture.
///
/// Draws nothing at all while faded out, takes no input (<c>NoInputs</c>) and
/// writes no game memory.
///
/// **Never judged by eye**: whether the top-right corner is where the eye is,
/// whether 1.75 s is long enough to notice and short enough not to nag, and
/// whether the cut reads as "released" over a bright scene.
