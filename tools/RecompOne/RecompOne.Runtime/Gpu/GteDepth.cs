/// <summary>
/// Per-vertex view depth and sub-pixel position, recovered from the GTE and looked
/// up again by screen position — the two pieces of information the GPU never gets,
/// and the reason PlayStation textures swim and its vertices wobble.
///
/// The GTE does the perspective divide itself: <c>RTPS</c>/<c>RTPT</c> project a
/// vertex to a 2D screen coordinate and the game copies that coordinate into a
/// GP0 packet. By the time the GPU sees a polygon there is no depth left in it, so
/// it can only interpolate U and V linearly across the screen — affine mapping,
/// which is exact only for a surface parallel to the screen and increasingly wrong
/// the more a surface is foreshortened. That is the swimming, and the diagonal
/// crease down a quad where its two triangles disagree.
///
/// So the depth has to be caught upstream and carried forward. <c>Gte.Rtp</c> knows
/// both halves at once — it computes the screen coordinate and the view depth SZ3
/// in the same call — and the screen coordinate is exactly what turns up in the
/// packet: <c>SatX</c>/<c>SatY</c> clamp it to 11 bits signed, which is the same
/// 11 bits <c>GpuRaster.CoordX</c> decodes. That makes the screen position a key
/// the two ends can share without tracking a single register or store.
///
/// The sub-pixel position is the same story told about the same number. The GTE
/// projects to 16.16 fixed point and then throws the low sixteen bits away:
/// <c>SX2</c> is a whole pixel, so a vertex sliding slowly across the screen sits
/// still and then jumps, and the polygon it belongs to shears as its corners jump
/// at different moments. That is the wobble. The fraction is right there in the
/// same expression as the depth, one shift earlier, and it is dropped for the same
/// reason — so it is caught in the same place and keyed the same way.
///
/// Hence a small hash table: the GTE writes (x, y) -> (z, fx, fy) as it projects,
/// and the GPU asks for it again as it decodes a vertex word. A hit gives the
/// polygon a W per vertex, so both renderers switch to perspective-correct
/// interpolation, and the fraction of a pixel the GTE truncated, so the vertex
/// lands where it was actually projected; a miss leaves the vertex exactly as it
/// was. **2D work therefore corrects itself** — a HUD sprite whose coordinates the
/// CPU computed was never in the table, so it keeps the affine mapping and the
/// pixel grid that 2D wants.
///
/// The two halves are read independently: <see cref="Enabled"/> serves the depth
/// and <see cref="Subpixel"/> the fraction, one lookup either way.
///
/// Screen position is not a unique key. Two vertices of different depths land on
/// the same pixel all the time — a distant wall behind a nearby column, or several
/// off-screen vertices clamped to ±1024 — and last-write-wins then hands one
/// polygon the other's W. A nearby floor that inherits a far Z looks as if the
/// camera jumped to the horizon; a vertex that inherits the wrong fraction jumps
/// by up to a pixel every time the winner changes. The table therefore keeps the
/// last few samples at each key, and <see cref="Apply"/> picks the set whose
/// depths belong together on the primitive being drawn. A leftover that is still
/// an obvious high outlier (one corner tens of times further than the other two,
/// with no geometric progression toward it) is dropped, so that triangle stays
/// affine rather than tearing.
///
/// Saturated coordinates are recorded too. Dropping them made every large nearby
/// wall and floor — the polygons that want correction most — fall back to affine
/// the moment one vertex left the ±1024 window, which is the pop that looks like
/// the vantage point jumped. The clamp is still the key, because that is what the
/// packet carries; uniqueness for W comes from keeping several samples and from
/// the primitive-level pick. **The position is not moved past the clamp.** Every
/// off-screen vertex the GPU would have stuck at ±1024 stays there, so a shared
/// edge whose other end is still on the wall does not open a hole. Only the
/// [0, 1) fraction of an on-screen vertex is served, and it is a function of the
/// key alone — two triangles that share a vertex look up the same fraction even
/// when they pick different depths.
///
/// The other properties of the table are unchanged:
///
///   * **Nothing is cleared per frame.** Entries carry a monotonic sequence number
///     and expire once the table's own capacity of vertices has been written past
///     them, which is a frame or two of geometry. That keeps the frame boundary
///     out of this file entirely — there is no hook to place and nothing to keep
///     in step with double buffering.
///   * **A primitive is all-or-nothing for W.** The caller only interpolates
///     perspectively when *every* vertex of the triangle hit, so a polygon can
///     never mix a real W with a fallback of 1 and shear itself apart. The
///     fraction needs no such rule and does not have one — see below.
///   * **A vertex behind the eye is not recorded at all.** <c>SZ3</c> of zero is a
///     vertex the divide could not place, and it is dropped for both halves
///     rather than for one, so turning the fraction on cannot change which
///     vertices carry a depth.
///
/// Why the fraction is per vertex where W is per primitive: W is an interpolation
/// parameter, and one corner disagreeing about it tears the texture across the
/// whole triangle. A fraction is just where the corner is. A triangle with one
/// corner moved by half a pixel is a triangle with one corner moved by half a
/// pixel, and — because two triangles sharing a vertex look up the same key and
/// get the same answer — a shared edge still has identical endpoints on both
/// sides of it, so no crack can open along one.
