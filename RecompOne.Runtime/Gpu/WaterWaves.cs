/// (the scrolling textures' dest rects), drawn in a batch the port says is water's
/// blend; the offset texel wraps inside that rectangle, as the upload itself does.
///
/// Nothing is drawn differently with <see cref="Enabled"/> off, into a planar
/// reflection, or for a fragment with no recovered depth. GL core only. Nothing here
