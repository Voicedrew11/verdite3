/// A light is one more term in <c>shade8</c>'s lit colour, added before the depth cue
/// and before the texture is modulated, so the game's own fog, texture and saturation
/// apply to it exactly as to the game's light. The port publishes each light already
/// in the GTE's view space (X right, Y down, Z into the screen, world units), since it
/// has the camera and the shader has only the fragment: the shader rebuilds the
/// fragment's view position from its recovered depth, the H and the centre, as
/// <c>NormalFs</c> does, and its normal from that position's screen derivatives.
///
/// A light reaches only a packet with a <see cref="GteLightMap"/> record, whose low
/// bytes are the colour the game lit it with (RGBC); the HUD and anything unrecorded
/// keep their vertex colour. None is drawn into a planar reflection's texture. GL
/// core only. Nothing here writes guest memory or the GTE.
